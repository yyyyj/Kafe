# Installing

*If you don't want to build the VM yourself, this is a good solution to rely on the lazy developper I am to get fresh releases*

Download the ZIP of the latest release of the Kafe VM : https://github.com/Loodoor/Kafe/releases and extract it where you want to install it. Nothing else is needed.
